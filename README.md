# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithm
The Python program implements the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm using Python libraries Numpy and SkLearn. It is be applicable for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm has been already been extended algorithm with a weighting function. 
The same code is also present in the kNN.ipynb file.
